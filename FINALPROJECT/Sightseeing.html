    <b>Old-Port of Montréal</b><br>
    One of my all time favorite places in Montréal is The Old-Port of Montréal. It is over 2km long and faces the St-Laurent River. The Port offers cycling, walking, roller blading and much more. It has many different exhibits that come and settle on the Port, for the summer heat and tourists. During the winter there are different festivals such as Igloofest and The festival Montréal en Lumière.
