    Hi, my name is Stacey Bee. I’m a 23 year old, who travels the world. I’ve been to 60 countries and have visited 4 of the 7 continents. I have my Bachelors of Geography from the University of Victoria. I’m born and raised in British Columbia. I grew up on Vancouver Island. I have 2 older sisters. I have been traveling for over 2 years now and enjoy every second of it. I love exploring new places and learning about new cultures. My most recent trip was to Montréal, Québec a few weeks ago and here are my recommendations, if Montréal is also on your list.
